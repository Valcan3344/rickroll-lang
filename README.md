## Hello World
**The syntax of RickRoll-Lang is not completely similar to Python**
1. It doesn't need indentation
2. The code must be written inside the main method, otherwise the interpreter will not execute
3. Every identifier (function or variable name) should contain more than one character
4. **The keywords can be separated freely**

Rick Roll-Lang:
```
take me to ur heart
    give msg up "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~\n"
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling msg
say goodbye
```
Equivalent to Python
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  msg = "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~\n"
  print(msg, end='')

```

Equivalent to C++
```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    string msg = "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~\n";
    cout<<msg;
}
```
**And you can get the output on your terminal:**

<br>
**Sorry, it's this:**
```
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~
```
**The keywords can be separated freely**
```
takemetourheart
    give msg up "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~\n"
    i justwanna telluhowim feeling msg
say good bye
```
This is also executable


## Run Code
Execute by converting .rickroll to Python
```shell
python3 RickRoll.py -py [Source Code File Name]
```
Execute by converting .rickroll to C++ (Requires g++ compiler and has numerous bugs)
```shell
python3 RickRoll.py -cpp [Source Code File Name]
```
Execute by interpreter
```shell
python3 RickRoll.py -intpr [Source Code File Name]
```
If you want to know the execution time:
> Add "--time"
```shell
python3 RickRoll.py -py [Source Code File Name] --time
```
Generate and play an audio from .rickroll
```shell
python3 RickRoll.py -py [Source Code File Name] --audio
```


## Features
- *[Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)*
- *Support [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3610/)*
- *Keywords/statements are all comming from [Rick Astley's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Astley) lyrics*
- *Keywords can be separated freely*
- *[Examples](https://github.com/Rick-Lang/rickroll-lang/tree/main/examples) to get started*
- *Translate RickRoll source code to Python3 and C++*
- *[Generate and play audios from .rickroll source code](https://github.com/Rick-Lang/rickroll-lang#Generate-Audio)*
- *Documentation for both English and Chinese*


## Generate Audio
How to use this generator:
```
python3 RickRoll.py -r [Source Code File Name] --audio
```
This generates an audio from the .rickroll program and plays it in your terminal

# Todo!
In order to make RICK ROll becoming a world heritage, YOU and I still have a bunch of things to do!
1. Add more keywords and built-in functions!
2. Write algorithms in RickRoll-Lang and upload them to [examples folder](examples).
3. Make syntax highlights for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html)!
4. Improve the current audio generator!
5. Improve the RickRoll interpreter!
6. Support "writing code by singing"!
7. Design a better icon!
8. [**SPREAD RICK ROLL EVERYWHERE!!!**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uT4y1P7CX)
